I've said this many times, but working on the terminal is just great! You get to
be very productive, quick and (as a bonus) you look so cool! ðŸ˜Ž But,
here's the thing, terminals (especially when working over a remote connection)
can be finicky. My question to you is, have you ever had one of the following
happen to you:
- The connection to a remote server drops, making you lose all your work
- You need to leave in a hurry but want to leave the remote process running, not
  fearing it will go away (pesky timeouts ðŸ”¥)
- You have a system without a working X11 (or Wayland) environment and wish to
  multi task?

Yes yes, there are some native tools to help you with all this, but it gets
tedious to juggle the `fg` and `bg` commands all the time.

Allow me to introduce you to a tool that I use to solve all those things - the
*Terminal Multiplexer* aka **tmux**.

# tmux or screen?

Yes, yes, yes. Tmux is not the first piece of software to do this, there is the
more famous [GNU screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) which has been
here for ages. Actually, screen is the first one I've seen, but somehow, for some
reason, I never got into it. I found tmux to be more approachable, more up my
alley. What am I trying to say with this long-winded intro? This will **not** be
a comparison between screen and tmux, nor will I attempt to say which one is
better. I prefer tmux, but screen is ever present. Let's not turn this into
another vim vs emacs discussion.

The goal of this post is to set you up and running with tmux and give you a
glimpse into how I configure and use tmux.

# Installing tmux

This guide / post is intended to cover the installation of tmux for Linux,
Mac OS. While you can run this under Windows (in WSL) I will not be giving that
any special treatment as it is basically the same like under Ubuntu.

So how do I install? Oh, this is pretty straightforward, depending on your
platform, but here are some options:

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -Syy
sudo pacman -S tmux
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmux
```

**MacOS / Homebrew:**
```bash
brew update
brew install tmux
```

Or if you wish to install it manually, check out their instructions
[here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing). The only dependencies that
are needed for a manual compilation and install are `libevent` and
`ncurses`.

That was pretty simple, and straight forward, so what now? Open up your favorite
terminal and run `tmux`. ðŸš€ 

# Keyboard shortcuts

This is where a lot of people just give up, as tmux is very vague about its
default keyboard shortcuts and unless you start searching the Internet for the
exact configuration, you see no difference (besides that green status bar)
between this or your standard terminal. What now?

![tmuxstart](/post-content/tmux/tmux-default.png "This looks pretty
uneventful")

Before we get into the weeds of tmux key bindings, I must first explain the
concept of the **prefix**. This is a key combination that precedes all other
keys when interacting with tmux. So it is critical to know it, and to change it
to something up your alley.

Let's say you wish to do a specific action on tmux - split the screen. What you
need to do first is, hit the Prefix and then the key that splits your screen.
**The default prefix is C-b (Control + b)**.


![tmuxstart](/post-content/tmux/pane-win.png "Here are the most important
elements of your tmux screen.")

Okay, let's start with the common uses of tmux with its default key bindings, and
I will show you how I configure it myself. **Remember the prefix is Control +
b**

| What you want to do | Key binding |
| --------------------| ------------|
| Splitting the window in half vertically | `Prefix + %` |
| Splitting the window in half horizontally | ` Prefix + "` |
| Creating a new Window | ` Prefix + c` |
| Switching between windows | ` Prefix + [0-9] ` |
| Switching between panes | ` Prefix + Arrow keys ` |
| Detach from tmux (leave it in the background)| ` Prefix + d ` |

And no, there is no big deal in exiting tmux. Just type exit until you have
closed all your windows and panes.

But let's say you wish to detach tmux, or send it to the background. Well, you
can do that with the `Prefix + d`. This will drop you back to your
tmuxless terminal. But how do you go back? Well, you can have multiple tmux
sessions available and running on your computer. To list them all just run
`tmux ls` this should get you something like this (if you have
multiple sessions running):
```bash
$ tmux ls
0: 2 windows (created Sun Mar 28 17:24:15 2021)
1: 1 windows (created Sun Mar 28 18:08:23 2021)
2: 1 windows (created Sun Mar 28 18:08:27 2021)
```
Now to attach to one of these you can either type `tmux att` which
will reattach you to your latest session, in my case it would be session *2*.
But to attach to a specific session, you can type the following:
```bash
tmux attach-session -t $the_id_of_your_session
```

This covers the basics on how you interact and work with tmux and using the
default key bindings. Which are fine, but they could be much much better.

Time to do more with tmux! Let's make it pretty and more functional. Let me show
you how I configure my tmux, which looks something like this:

![mytmux](/post-content/tmux/mytmux.png "This is how my tmux looks like. It's not
much but I like it.")

# Configuring your `.tmux.conf`

This is the file where all your tmux configuration exists. And by default, tmux
looks for it at the *root of your home directory*.

## Basic configuration

Straight off the bat, let's change that **Prefix** key! I am not a fan of the
**Control+b** combination, as it makes me move my hands too much so I will remap
it to **Control+a**. To do that, add the following lines to your fresh brand new
*.tmux.conf*:

```bash showLineNumbers
## Replace c-B with c-A
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key -r C-a send-prefix
```

Time to add some **colors** to our terminal, and well keep any remote session
friendly. This is done by enabling the 256-color mode by setting the default
terminal to `screen-256color`. There are other options that might
work for you, but this one has been the most beneficial for me:

```bash showLineNumbers
## Set 256 color mode
set-option -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
```
**Window numbers** are important, while - yes I know - all arrays start at 0. I prefer
to have my tmux windows start at 1. Hence the following settings makes it so,
and it also renumbers the windows, if I happen to close one.

```bash showLineNumbers
## Number windows starting at 1, renumber as windows are added / removed
set-option -g base-index 1
set-option -g renumber-windows on
```

The **copy mode** of tmux is very powerful, it gives you the ability to scroll up
and down across the entirety of the output. And also, the ability to grab text
from there and yank it into your clipboard. The default key binding for this
is `Prefix + [`. The only thing I add to this, is the option to use
vi key movement as a personal preference.
```bash showLineNumbers
## Use vim keybindings in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi
```

## Performance

How about some speed and performance improvements? This is specific to my setup
(as I happen to use neovim), but I am sure you can benefit from this as well.

So, let's configure the **title bar refresh interval**, the setting that tells
the tmux title bar how long to wait before updating its content (clock, weather,
or what-not). And also, let's configure the **escape-time**, the time in milliseconds
for which tmux waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a
  function or meta key sequences.  
```bash showLineNumbers
## For neovim - escape time interval
set-option -sg escape-time 0

## Sets the refresh rate of the status bar
set -g status-interval 60
```

## My custom key bindings

In this section we will look at the way I changed some of the default
key bindings to things that make sense to me. It's not much, but I am so much
used to this now - that I would not change it.

**Reloading** your tmux configuration with a keystroke is paramount for anyone
who loves tinkering. So here is a simple key combination I set up just for
that: `Prefix + r`:
```bash showLineNumbers
## Easy reload
bind-key r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "~/.tmux.conf reloaded"
```

When it comes to managing windows and panes, I've made some changes in the way I
transition between different windows and the keys that split my windows into
panes. 

Namely I love the option to **quickly switch** back and forth between two different
windows with a single keystroke. So, if I hit `Prefix + Ctrl+A` I get
to go back between the current window and the one I was before. Neat!
```bash showLineNumbers
## Go back to last window
bind-key C-a last-window

## More intuitive pane splitting key-bindings, open all in current path
bind-key - split-window -v  -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind-key \\ split-window -h  -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'

## Kill windows 
bind-key C-w kill-pane
```
Finally, some **resizing** key bindings are in order. Here I just give me the
ability to use the arrow keys with the combination of Shift or Control to change
the size of the panes. As you can see here - there is no Prefix key needed.  

```bash showLineNumbers
## Easy resizing of panes with fine and coarse adjustment
bind -n S-Left resize-pane -L 2
bind -n S-Right resize-pane -R 2
bind -n S-Down resize-pane -D 1
bind -n S-Up resize-pane -U 1
bind -n C-Left resize-pane -L 10
bind -n C-Right resize-pane -R 10
bind -n C-Down resize-pane -D 5
bind -n C-Up resize-pane -U 5
```

Here is how some of my **custom key bindings** are setup now:

| What you want to do | Key binding |
| --------------------| ------------|
| Reload your tmux configuration file | ` Prefix + r ` |
| Splitting the window in half vertically | ` Prefix + \ ` |
| Splitting the window in half horizontally | ` Prefix + -` |
| Creating a new Window | ` Prefix + c` |
| Switching between windows | ` Prefix + [0-9] ` |
| Switching between panes | `Ctrl + [h,j,k,l] ` |
| Kill window | ` Prefix + Ctrl + w ` |
| Switch back to the previous window | ` Prefix + Ctrl + a ` |
| Resize panes in small steps | ` Shift + Arrow keys ` |
| Resize panes in big steps | ` Ctrl + Arrow keys ` |

## Integration with vim

Here is one thing I need to have in my tmux setup so it would work with vim. Vim
also supports splitting your screen into panes. In order not to confuse the two
when working with both, I use one plug in for vim and a few lines of
configuration for tmux for it to work. *If you are not using vim, feel free to
ignore this*.

The first thing you need to do is install
[this](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) plugin, into your vim
setup. How you do that is up to you. Either manually or with the use of a vim
plugin manager, there are instructions on the github page of this plugin.

Now, add the following lines to your tmux configuration file:
```bash showLineNumbers
## Seamless aviation using vim-tmux-navigator (github christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)
is_vim='echo "#{pane_current_command}" | grep -iqE "(^|\/)g?(view|n?vim?)(diff)?$"'
bind -n C-h if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-h" "select-pane -L"
bind -n C-j if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-j" "select-pane -D"
bind -n C-k if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-k" "select-pane -U"
bind -n C-l if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-l" "select-pane -R"
bind -n C-\\ if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-\\" "select-pane -l"
```
And now you should be able to seamlessly switch between your vim panes and your
tmux panes! **#productivity** ðŸ’¥ 

# Bring some colors into your life ðŸŒˆ 

Last, but definitely not least - some colors. Now this is the official **Gruvbox
dark** [color scheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), but with some minor
tweaks to the status line. And the status line is pretty simple, no specific
scripts, plugins or the like (weather, battery ...). I like to keep it light
like that!

Just a note about the colors here. Tmux is using the 256 color capabilities of
my terminal. So when it says `colour222` this refers to the exact
color in the terminal - so your mileage may vary.

*BTW: If you wish to see what your colors are, you can run this simple bash
one-liner:*
```bash
for COLOR in {1..255}; do echo -en "\e[38;5;${COLOR}m${COLOR} "; done; echo;
```

Onward to the colorscheme ðŸš€ 

Here is how my status bar looks right now, with he latest changes implemented:
![statusbar](/post-content/tmux/status-bar.png "This is how it looks on Mac OS,
together with vim")

And this is the part of my `.tmux.conf` that configures all that, so
feel free to copy paste it into yours.

```bash showLineNumbers
# C O L O R S
## COLORSCHEME: gruvbox dark
set-option -g status "on"

# default statusbar color
set-option -g status-style bg=colour237,fg=colour223 # bg=bg1, fg=fg1

## Theme settings mixed with colors (unfortunately, but there is no cleaner way)
set-option -g status-justify "left"
set-option -g status-left-style none
set-option -g status-left-length "80"
set-option -g status-right-style none
set-option -g status-right-length "80"
set-window-option -g window-status-separator ""

## Status Bar
set-option -g status-left "#[fg=colour250, bg=colour241] #S #[fg=colour241, bg=colour237, nobold, noitalics, nounderscore]"
set-option -g status-right "#[fg=colour239, bg=colour237, nobold, nounderscore, noitalics]#[fg=colour246,bg=colour239] %Y-%m-%d #[fg=colour230,bg=colour244] %H:%M #[fg=colour248, bg=colour239, nobold, noitalics, nounderscore]#[fg=colour237, bg=colour255] darko@#h "

set-window-option -g window-status-current-format "#[fg=colour237, bg=colour214, nobold, noitalics, nounderscore]#[fg=colour239, bg=colour221] #I #[fg=colour239, bg=colour214, bold] #W #[fg=colour214, bg=colour237, nobold, noitalics, nounderscore]"
set-window-option -g window-status-format "#[fg=colour237,bg=colour239,noitalics]#[fg=colour223,bg=colour239] #I #[fg=colour223, bg=colour239] #W #[fg=colour239, bg=colour237, noitalics]"
```

# Wrap up and links to stuff!

Ever since I've started using tmux (about 6 years ago), it has changed the way I
approach working with terminals. Long gone are the days of multiple different
open terminal windows across the desktop. I've even stopped using the built-in
tabbing capabilities of some modern terminal emulators. And now have the ability
to jump on a system, and even without access to a fancy X11 Graphics environment,
am able to multi task and be much more productive. This has proved to be
especially useful when working on remote systems with SSH.

On top of all that, just the fact that you can split your screen into multiple
different terminals, and arrange them to your liking. Gives you the ability to
make your vim setup into a proper Development Environment.

Hopefully this post has given you some inspiration to use tmux, and that the
configuration shared here can help you make your tmux environment just the way
you want it.
